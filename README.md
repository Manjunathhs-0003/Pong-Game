<h1>Pong Game</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game. It features two paddles controlled by the players, and a ball that bounces between them. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing the player's paddle while attempting to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.</p>
